<div class="explain">
To round out our example, we need to add a few more files. First is going to be the <code>html</code> page. This will just be an input, a button and a container for displaying the text.
</div>

#### index.html
```html
<html>
    <head></head>
    <body>
        <div>
            <label for="your-name">Your Name</label>
            <input type="text" id="your-name" />
            <button id="say-hello" type="button">Say Hello</button>
        </div>
        <div id="message-container"></div>
        <script src="index.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    </body>
</html>
```
which looks like this

![Hello World!]({{"/assets/img/hw.html.png" | relative_url}})

<div class="explain">
Next we need setup a js file to call the functions defined in our wasm-bindgen js file. The first line here is going to use a special function for webpack that will import the module called <code>import</code> which returns a promise. The promise will resolve when our module is done loading, at that point we are going to assign the result to our global variable <code>hw</code>. Now that we know hw is available to use, we want to register an event listener on our button that will call <code>sayHello</code>. This function gets a value from the input and if it is empty calls the "Hello, world!" version and if not will pass the value to the custom version, this is where we are going to be using the actual Web Assembly module we created. It then passes the result to <code>updateMessage</code>, this function simply finds the container we made, empties it of all content and then inserts our text wrapped in an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>.
</div>

#### index.js
```js
const mod = import('./hello_world');
let hw;
mod.then(wasm => {
    hw = wasm;
    let btn = document.getElementById('say-hello');
    if (!btn) return console.error('No button found');
    btn.addEventListener('click', sayHello);
});

function sayHello() {
    let input = document.getElementById('your-name');
    if (!input || input.value == '') {
        updateMessage(hw.generate_greeting());
    } else {
        updateMessage(hw.generate_custom_greeting(input.value));
    }
}

function updateMessage(msg) {
    let div = document.getElementById('message-container');
    if (!div) return console.error('No message-container div found');
    while (div.hasChildNodes()) {
        div.removeChild(div.lastChild);
    }
    let h1 = document.createElement('h1');
    h1.appendChild(document.createTextNode(msg))
    div.appendChild(h1);
}
```
<div class="explain">
Now we will need to create our <code>package.json</code> file and add the required webpack dev-dependencies. I chose to use <code>yarn</code> but you could use <code>npm</code> just the same.
</div>

#### add webpack
```bash
$ yarn init
...
$ yarn add -D webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server
...
```
<div class="explain">
Last thing we need before we can run the test is a webpack config file. This is about as simple as it can be made.
</div>

#### webpack.config.js
```js
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  entry: "./index.js",
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist"),
    filename: "index.js",
  },
  mode: "development"
};
```
<div class="explain">
<p>
Now we can use the webpack development server to view our work. In this state, the application will only work in firefox, if you want it to work in chrome you would need to make a few modifications.
</p>
<p>
I go over these modifications <a href="{{"/steps/10.2.1-the-bindgen.html" | relative_url}}">here</a> though that is for our next example, so it will not map directly to what we have here. You also may want to look at the <code>wasm2es6js</code> tool that comes with <code>wasm-bindgen-cli</code>, you can learn more about how/why <a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen/tree/master/examples/hello_world#caveat-for-chrome-users">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
You can run it locally with the following command. I have included a live demo link below if you just want to see it now.
</p>
</div>

### run the server
```bash
$ webpack-dev-server
```
<p class="explain">For the impatient, here it is working from github pages:</p>
