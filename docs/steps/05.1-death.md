Not any time soon.

<div class="explain">

<p>WASM was adopted as a minimum viable product in June 2015, almost 3 years later there is still a lot to be done. </p>

<p>Currently WASM doesn't have access to the DOM, garbage collection, or access to system information (like <code>Date</code>). This means that the only way to interact with the user's experience is through a connection to the <code>javascript</code> context. Currently the only information that can pass from one context to the other is <code>number</code>s, the rest has to be pushed into shared memory and then the location and size of that memory can be passed between. This makes for a pretty complicated system.</p>

<p>While there may be an opportunity to move past these current limitations, it is going to take a long time to get there. Currently the <a href="http://webassembly.org/roadmap/">Webassembly Roadmap</a> is almost all about stabilization and infrastructure and while the post-mvp features are listed as "in-progress" none of those are about <code>DOM</code> interaction.</p>
