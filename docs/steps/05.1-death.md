Not any time soon.

<div class="explain">

<p>WASM was adopted as a minimum viable product in June 2015, almost 3 years later there is still a lot to be done. </p>

<p>Currently the only information that can pass from one context to the other is <code>number</code>s, the rest has to be pushed into shared memory and then the location can be passed between but the function that receives it needs to have a way to know how long the data is. This makes for a pretty complicated system.</p>

<p>While there may be an opportunity to move past these current limitations, it is going to take a long time to get there. Currently the <a href="http://webassembly.org/roadmap/">Webassembly Roadmap</a> is almost all about stabilization and infrastructure and while the post-mvp features are listed as "in-progress" none of those are directly about <code>DOM</code> interaction and the status is a reference to the state of the proposal, not the implementation. Needless to say WASM is a long way from being a JS killer.</p>
