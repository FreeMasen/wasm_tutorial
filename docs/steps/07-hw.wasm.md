<div class="explain">
Before we get started we need to make sure that a few more things are installed.
</div>

```bash
$ rustup install nightly 
...
$ rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
...
$ cargo install wasm-bindgen-cli
```
<div class="explain">
<p>First we need to install the nightly version of the compiler, this will allow us to use some experimental features. Next we need to have the <code>WASM</code> target installed. Lastly we need to install the command line tool that is going to help make this all a little easier.</p>

<p>We are going to use the same <code>lib.rs</code> file that we were using before but we need to update a few things about our project.</p>

<p>first we can delete the main.rs file, you don't have to but it might trip you up.</p>

<p>Once we have done that we need to add a dependency to our <code>lib.rs</code> file. We also need to make sure that the compiler knows we want to get back a dynamically linked library instead of the default. To do that we need to add a <code>[lib]</code> section and in it define the <code>crate-type</code> to include "cdylib" which is just short for a <code>C</code> dynamic library.</p>
</div>

#### Cargo.toml
```toml
[package]
name = "hello_world"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["robert masen <r@robertmasen.pizza>"]

[dependencies]
wasm-bindgen = "0.2"

[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]
```
<div class="explain">
Once we have completed that, we need to update our <code>lib.rs</code> to expose our functions to as exports.
</div>

#### lib.rs
```rust
#![feature(proc_macro, wasm_custom_section, wasm_import_module)]
extern crate wasm_bindgen;
use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn generate_greeting() -> String {
    "Hello, world!".to_string()
}
#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn generate_custom_greeting(name: &str) -> String {
    format!("Hello, {}!", name);
}
```
<div class="explain">
<p>Here there are a few things to unpack. First we have the <code>#![feature(...)]</code> statement, this is turning on a few custom features that are not normally enabled in rust. </p>
<ul>
    <li><code>proc_macro</code>: Procedural macros (thats the #[wasm_bindgen] statmenet</li>
    <li><code>wasm_custom_section</code>: This allows the compiler to have a non-standard section added to our output</li>
    <li><code>wasm_import_module</code>: This allows the wasm file to define imports from another context</li>
</ul>
<p>After that, we define out need for the external library <code>wasm_bindgen</code> and then use everything in that library's <code>prelude</code> module. This makes available to us the primary functions/types of the library.</p>

<p>We also need to annotate the functions we want to expose with the <code>#[wasm_bindgen]</code> macro. This will generate the glue code needed for moving types that are more complex than <code>number</code>s between the contexts.</p>

<p>With those changes, we can now build our wasm module. We are going to use the new stuff we added with our <code>rustup</code> and <code>cargo</code> commands earlier.</p>
</div>

```bash
$ cargo +nightly build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
```
<div class="explain">
The first time you run this it will probably take a while. 

Once that is complete you would have a <code>.wasm</code> file in the target folder.

The next step is to generate our bindings.
</div>

```bash
$ wasm-bindgen ./target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/debug/hello_world.wasm --out-dir .
```

<div class="explain">
This will generate 2 files in our project's root folder, <code>hello_world_bg.wasm</code> and <code>hello_world.js</code>.
lets take a look at the <code>.js</code> file.
