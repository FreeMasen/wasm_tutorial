If you are not familiar with Generic Types and/or Enums with associated values, here is an example of some rust that leverages both.

```rust
struct Person<T> {
    name: String,
    associates: T,
}
enum Associate {
    Person(String),
    Pet(String, u32),
}

fn main() {
    let person_a = Person {
        name: "Aye",
        associates: "Steve".to_string(),
    };
    let person_b = Person {
        name: "Bea",
        associates: vec![
            Associate::Person("James".into()),
            Associate::Person("Helen".into()),
            Associate::Person("Edwardo".into()),
            Associate::Person("Maya".into()),
            Associate::Pet("Fido".into(), 4),
        ]
    };
}
```

First we have the definition of <code>Person</code>, this <code>struct</code>will have two fields, their name and their associates. In the definition we have included <code>&lt;T&gt;</code>which is a standard way to say that something about a type is customizable. We set the type of name to <code>String</code>and the type of associates to <code>T</code>, this would allow anyone who constructed a <code>Person</code>to say what the type of associates is going to be. So if you wanted the associate field to just be a string because that person has 1 friend, you could do that or you could set the field to be a list of strings if they had more friends.

Next we have the <code>Associate</code>enum, like a standard <code>C</code>style enum we list the cases that this type can be. In addition, we can then associate some data with each case. So the <code>Associate::Person</code>can hold onto a string, presumably the name of that person and the <code>Associate::Pet</code>can hold onto a string and an integer, the name and number of legs. 

inside the main function we have defined 2 people, <code>person_a</code>has a name and their associate is just 1 name while <code>person_b</code>'s associates are a list of 4 <code>Associate::Person</code>and 1 <code>Associate::Pet</code>.
