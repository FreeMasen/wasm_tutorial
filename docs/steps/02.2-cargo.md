<div class="explain">

<code>cargo</code> is a a friendly wrapper around <code>rustc</code> with some very helpful features added on, It works a lot like <code>nmp</code>.

<h3>Dependency Management</h3>

When you build using cargo it will download all of your required dependencies you define those in a file named <code>Cargo.toml</code>.
</div>

#### Cargo.toml

```toml
[package]
name = "wasm_tutorial"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["robert masen <r@robertmasen.pizza>"]

[dependencies]
clap = "*"
byteorder = "1.2.2"

[target.win32.dependencies]
winapi = "0.3.4"

[dev-dependencies]
wasm-bindgen-cli = "0.2"
```
Not much different than a <code>package.json</code>.

<h3>Utility Management</h3>

You can install programs published to <a href="https://crates.io">crates.io</a> for use from the commandline.
</div>

```bash
$ cargo install wasm-bindgen-cli
...
wasm-bindgen-cli
...
```
not much different than `npm i -g typescript`
