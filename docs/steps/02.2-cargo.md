<div class="explain">
<p>As I stated before, <code>cargo</code> is a a friendly wrapper around <code>rustc</code> with some very helpful features added on, It works a lot like <code>npm</code>.</p>

<h3>Dependency Management</h3>

<p>When you build using cargo it will download all of the required dependencies you have defined in a file named <code>Cargo.toml</code>.</p>
</div>

#### Cargo.toml

```toml
[package]
name = "wasm_tutorial"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["robert masen <r@robertmasen.pizza>"]

[dependencies]
clap = "*"
byteorder = "1.2.2"

[target.win32.dependencies]
winapi = "0.3.4"

[dev-dependencies]
wasm-bindgen-cli = "0.2"
```
Not much different than a <code>package.json</code>.

<div class="explain">
<p>The main difference is that it uses a language called <a href="https://github.com/toml-lang/toml">TOML</a>. TOML is not much different from JSON, object are described by using the object's name in brackets <code>[package]</code> and if you need additional nesting you can use <code>.</code> notation to go deeper, <code>[target.win32.dependencies]</code>. Below the name, the properties are 1 on each line with  the key and value separated by an equal sign <code>clap = "*"</code>. There is a lot more that you can do but that will at least get you started.</p>

<h3>Utility Management</h3>

<p>You can install programs published to <a href="https://crates.io">crates.io</a> for use from the command line.</p>
</div>

```bash
$ cargo install wasm-bindgen-cli
...
wasm-bindgen-cli
...
```
not much different than `npm i -g typescript`
