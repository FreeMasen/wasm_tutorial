<div class="explain">
<code>Message</code> is an enum, describing the 6 different kinds of messages that we will be sending over to/from the client. 
</div>

```rust
pub enum Message {
    GetAll,
    All(Vec<ToDo>),
    Add(ToDo),
    Update(ToDo),
    Remove(i32),
    Error(String),
}
```
<ul class="explain">
<li>
<code>GetAll</code> - This case will be used to denote the client requesting all of the items in a to do list.
</li>
<li>
<code>All(Vec&lt;ToDo&gt;)</code> - This case will be the server's reply with a list of <code>ToDo</code>s
</li>
<li>
<code>Add(ToDo)</code> - This case will be used to add a new item to the data store, it will include a single <code>ToDo</code>
</li>
<li><code>Update(ToDo)</code> - This case will replace an existing version in the data store with the included <code>ToDo</code>
</li>
<li><code>Remove(i32)</code> - This case remove an item from the data store, it will include a the <code>id</code> of the <code>ToDo</code> that should be removed
</li>
<li>
<code>Error(String)</code> - This case will represent a server error, it will include a message describing the error
</li>
</ul>

<div class="explain">
Here you can see how we have defined the associated values that I referred to on the previous page. In our <code>All(Vec&lt;ToDo&gt;)</code> case we have the associated value of a <code>Vec</code> (one of rust's array types) of <code>ToDo</code>s, you can define any number of these values by just putting them in parenthesis separated by a comma. This pairing of information becomes super useful when you are evaluating the data later, below is an example using rust's version of a <code>switch</code> statement, called a <code>match</code>. In a <code>match</code> each case will be a new line with the case followed by a fat arrow (<code>=></code>) and then a block wrapped in curly braces.
</div>

### Enum example
```rust
fn todo_route(message: Message) {
    match message {
        Message::GetAll => {
            //get all of the messages from the data store
            DataStore::get_all();
        },
        Message::All(todos) => {
            //todos is now a variable that we can use
            println!("ToDos: {:?}", todos);
        },
        Message::Add(todo) => {
            //add the variable todo to data store
            DataStore::add(todo);
        },
        Message::Update(todo) => {
            //use the variable todo to update the data store
            DataStore::Update(todo);
        },
        Message::Remove(id) => {
            //use the variable id to remove a ToDo from the data store
            DataStore::Remove(id);
        },
        Message::Error(msg) => {
            //print the error to the console
            println!("Error in todo_route. {}", msg);
        }
    }
}
```
<div class="explain">
<p>Just like in a switch statement, each case will have its own block inside of that block we have access to the variable we named in the parentheses. When you have an enum that is closely associated with some data, this is a very nice feature. </p>

<p>We also have an <code>impl</code> block for the <code>Message</code> type with 3 functions.</p>
</div>

### Message's functions
```rust
impl Message {
    pub fn for_error(data: impl Into<String>) -> Message {
        Message::Error(data.into())
    }

    pub fn to_bytes(self) -> Vec<u8> {
        serialize(&self).unwrap_or(vec!())
    }

    pub fn from_bytes(bytes: Vec<u8>) -> Result<Message, String> {
        match deserialize(&bytes) {
            Ok(msg) => Ok(msg),
            Err(e) => Err(format!("{:?}", e))
        }
    }
}
```
<div class="explain">
<p>
Here we have 3 function, the first is a special constructor to make building the <code>Error</code> case a little easier.
</p>
<p>
Next we have our first instance function, note that the only argument to this function is <code>self</code>, this is a special value representing the current instance. <code>to_bytes</code> is a convenience method for serializing the <code>Message</code> into bytes. 
</p>
<p>
lastly we have another special constructor, this one takes in some bytes and attempts to deserialize them into a <code>Message</code>. Notice that this function returns <code>Result&lt;Message, String&gt;</code>, <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> is an enum provided by rust that has two cases <code>Ok(T)</code> and <code>Err(E)</code>. That means anything that is a result could be one of two options, a success case that will have the type <code>T</code> or a failure case that will have the type <code>E</code>. If you are not familiar with "generic" notation like this, we are using the letters T and E as place holders for types to be defined later, this is a very useful tool when working in a strongly typed language like rust. Since deserialization can fail we need to tell anyone using our function about this possible failure and <code>Result</code> does just that. Anyone using this special constructor is going to need to use a match statement to get either the <code>Message</code> if everything is ok or an explanation of why it failed to deserialize.
