<div class="explain">
To use our library, we need to modify our <code>main.rs</code> file to look like this.
</div>

#### main.rs
```rust
extern crate hello_world;

use hello_world::{generate_greeting, generate_custom_greeting};

fn main() {
    println!("{}", generate_greeting());
    println!("{}", generate_custom_greeting("Robert"));
}
```
<div class="explain">
<p>On the first line we declare that we will be using an external library with <code>extern crate [package_name];</code> at that point we can use the two functions we defined in our library.</p>

<p>Next we want to bring them into scope directly so we add the line
<code>use hello_world::{generate_greeting, generate_custom_greeting};</code>
If we didn't add that line we could still use them like this
<code>hello_world::generate_greeting()</code>
which is a little less nice.</p>
</div>

When we run our program, we should now get the following output
```bash
$ cargo run
...
Hello, world!
Hello, Robert!
```
