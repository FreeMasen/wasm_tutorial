<div class="explain">

To use our libaray, we need to modify our <code>main.rs</code> file to look like this.
</div>

#### main.rs
```rust
extern crate hello_world;

use hello_world::{generate_greeting, generate_custom_greeting};

fn main() {
    println!("{}", generate_greeting());
    println!("{}", generate_custom_greeting("Robert"));
}
```
<div class="explain">

On the first line we declare that we will be using an external library with <code>extern crate [package_name];</code>
at that point we can use the two functions we defined in our library.

They are namespaced as <code>hello_world::[function_name]</code>, we could get around having to use that in the calling location by putting <code>use hello_world</code> just below <code>extern crate</code>.
