Before we get started we need to make sure that a few more things are installed.
</div>

```bash
$ rustup install nightly 
...
$ rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
...
$ cargo install wasm-bindgen-cli
```
<div class="explain">
We are going to use the same <code>lib.rs</code> file that we were using before but we need to update a few things about our project.

first we can delete the main.rs file, you don't have to but it might trip you up.

Once we have done that we need to add a dependency to our <code>lib.rs</code> file.
</div>

#### Cargo.toml
```toml
[package]
name = "hello_world"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["robert masen <r@robertmasen.pizza>"]

[dependencies]
wasm-bindgen = "0.2"

```

Once we have completed that, we need to update our <code>lib.rs</code> to expose our functions to <code>js</code>.
