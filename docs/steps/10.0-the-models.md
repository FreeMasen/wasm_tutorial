<p>
The server developer was nice enough to share these models with you, to ease development.
There are two basic structures here, a <code>ToDo</code> struct and a <code>Message</code> enum.</p>
<p>Before we go over the details of these models there are two concepts you should know about.</p>
<p>Structs are Rust's way of defining objects. When defining a struct you can only define fields/properties for an object, all struct methods must be defined in a separate <code>impl</code> block.
</p>
<p>
Enums in rust work a bit differently than standard <code>C</code> style enums, the biggest difference
being the ability to associate dynamic values with cases. The other big difference is that enums can have
<code>impl</code> blocks, meaning that they can have methods!
</p>
<p>With that out of the way, lets go over how they are being used here.</p>
