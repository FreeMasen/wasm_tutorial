<div class="explain">
<p>
The server developer was nice enough to share these models with you, to ease development.
There are two basic structures here, a ToDo <code>struct</code> and a Message <code>enum</code>.</p>
<p>
Structs act like classes in most languages, though they are stack allocated like most languages that
have both structs and classes. A struct block can only define fields/properties for an object, not any
behavior. All struct methods must be defined in an <code>impl</code> block, this just allows for more
flexability in organizing your code.
</p>
<p>
Enums in rust work quite a bit differently than standard <code>C</code> style enums, the biggest difference
being the ability to associate dynamic values with cases. The other big difference is that enums can have
<code>impl</code> blocks, meaning that enums can have methods!
</p>
<p>Let's dig a little deeper into the models we will be using</p>
</div>
### ToDo

```rust
/// This represents a single todo item it will have a unique ID,
/// a flag whether or not it has been completed and
/// the action that should be taken to complete
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, PartialEq, Debug, Clone)]
pub struct ToDo {
    pub id: i32,
    pub complete: bool,
    pub action: String,
}

impl ToDo {
    /// construct a new ToDo item
    pub fn new(id: i32, complete: bool, action: impl Into<String>) -> ToDo {
        ToDo {
            id,
            complete,
            action: action.into()
        }
    }
}
```
<div class="explain">
<p>This struct will represent a ToDo item, it should look familiar to the json definition in our original spec.</p>
<ul>
<li>id - <code>i32</code>: This will be our numeric id.</li>
<li>complete - <code>bool</code>: This will be true or false depending on if the action was completed</li>
<li>action - <code>String</code>: This will be the text describing our action.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will notice that two of the types might look a little strange. <code>i32</code> is rust's keyword for a 32bit signed integer. If you don't know what that means, don't worry too much, just know that signed means it can be negative or positive. The other thing that might look strange is that <code>String</code> has a capital S, that is because this string is actually heap allocated type, if you don't know what that means it really isn't that important at this point.</p>
<p>ToDo also has an <code>impl</code> block defined for it, inside of this block there is 1 function. This function is static (meaning it doesn't need an instance of ToDo) and will act as our constructor. We denote static and instance methods by either providing or omitting the first argument of <code>self</code>, that is how we know this is static (no <code>self</code>). This function takes 3 arguments, a number for the id, a boolean for the completeness and anything that implements a function that will convert it <code>Into</code> a <code>String</code> as the description of the action. I am not going to dig too far into the action variable, just know that rust has a system like <code>interface</code>s to allow for this kind of thing, they are called <code>Trait</code>s. This argument's type is saying it <code>impl</code>ements the <code>Trait</code> named <code>Into</code> specifically a flavor that will convert it into a <code>String</code>. 
</p>

### Message

```rust
/// A representation of our messages traveling between
/// the server and the client
#[derive(Debug, Deserialize, Serialize, PartialEq, Clone)]
pub enum Message {
    /// A message from the client to the server to
    /// get all of the ToDo items
    GetAll,
    /// A message from the server to the client with
    /// all of the todo items include.
    /// This will be returned with every request from the client
    All(Vec<ToDo>),
    /// A message from the client to add a new ToDo to the list
    Add(ToDo),
    /// A message from the client to update an existing ToDo
    Update(ToDo),
    /// A message from the client to remove an existing ToDo
    /// with a matching id
    Remove(i32),
    /// A message from the server with an Error message
    Error(String),
}

impl Message {
    /// Constructor for our Error type
    pub fn for_error(data: impl Into<String>) -> Message {
        Message::Error(data.into())
    }
    /// A convience function for serializing a message
    /// to Bincode
    pub fn to_bytes(self) -> Vec<u8> {
        serialize(&self).unwrap_or(vec!())
    }
    /// A convience function for deserializing a message
    /// from Bincode
    pub fn from_bytes(bytes: Vec<u8>) -> Result<Message, String> {
        match deserialize(&bytes) {
            Ok(msg) => Ok(msg),
            Err(e) => Err(format!("{:?}", e))
        }
    }
}
```
