<p>
The server developer was nice enough to share these models with you, to ease development.
There are two basic structures here, a <code>ToDo</code> "struct" and a <code>Message</code> "enum".</p>
<p>
Before we go over the details of these models let's go over what "struct" and "enum" are in Rust.
</p>
<p>
Structs are Rust's way of defining objects. When defining a struct you first define the fields/properties, if you need to add any functions or methods you would do that in a separate code block called an <code>impl</code> block.
</p>
<p>
Enums in rust work a bit differently than in most languages, the biggest difference
being the ability to associate dynamic values with cases. This is useful when you have a case that is closely tied to some data, you'll see what I mean when we get to the <code>Message</code> enum. The other big difference is that enums can have their own <code>impl</code> blocks, meaning they can have functions/methods too!
</p>
<p>With that out of the way, lets take a look at what the server developer provided.</p>
