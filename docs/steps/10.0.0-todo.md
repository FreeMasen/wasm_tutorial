```rust 
pub struct ToDo {
    pub id: i32,
    pub complete: bool,
    pub action: String,
}
```

<div class="explain">
<p>This struct will represent a ToDo item, it should look similar to the json definition in our original spec.</p>
<ul>
<li>
id - <code>i32</code>: This will be our numeric id
</li>
<li>
complete - <code>bool</code>: This will be true or false depending on if the action was completed
</li>
<li>
action - <code>String</code>: This will be the text describing our action
</li>
</ul>

<p>You might have noticed that the <code>id</code> property's type is <code>i32</code> rust requires you not only label number types as numbers but with a more specific definition. All of the number types start with either the letter i (integer, positive or negative whole number), u (unsigned integer, always positive whole number) or f (floating point, number with a decimal) followed by their "bit-ness". Currently for i and u these include 8, 16, 32, 64 and 128 while for f it would either be 32 and 64.</p>
</div>

```rust
impl ToDo {
    /// can be used like this 
    /// ```
    /// let todo = ToDo::new(String::from("thing"))
    /// ```
    pub fn new(action: String) -> ToDo {
        ToDo {
            id: -1,
            complete: false,
            action: action,
        }
    }
}
```

<div class="explain">
<p>
ToDo also has an <code>impl</code> block defining 1 function which will act as a convenience constructor for brand new ToDos. This function takes 1 arguments a string describing the <code>action</code> and will set the <code>id</code> to -1 and <code>complete</code> to false.
