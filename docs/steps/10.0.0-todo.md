```rust 
pub struct ToDo {
    pub id: i32,
    pub complete: bool,
    pub action: String,
}
```

<div class="explain">
<p>This struct will represent a ToDo item, it should look familiar to the json definition in our original spec.</p>
<ul>
<li>
id - <code>i32</code>: This will be our numeric id
</li>
<li>
complete - <code>bool</code>: This will be true or false depending on if the action was completed
</li>
<li>
action - <code>String</code>: This will be the text describing our action
</li>
</ul>

<p>You might have noticed that the <code>id</code> property's type is <code>i32</code> rust requires you not only label number types as numbers but also with their more specific definition. All of the number types start with either the letter i (integer, positive or negative whole number), u (unsigned integer, always positive whole number) or f (floating point, number with a decimal) followed by their "bit-ness". Currently for i and u these include 8, 16, 32, 64 and 128 while for f it would either be 32 and 64.</p>
</div>

```rust
impl ToDo {
    pub fn new(id: i32, complete: bool, action: impl Into<String>) -> ToDo {
        ToDo {
            id,
            complete,
            action: action.into()
        }
    }
}
```

<div class="explain">
<p>
ToDo also has an <code>impl</code> block defining 1 function which will act as a constructor. This function takes 3 arguments, a number for the id, a boolean for the completeness and a string for the action. You probably noticed that the action parameter's type isn't <code>String</code> instead we are using the type <code>Into&lt;String&gt;</code>, rust strings are a bit tricky this special type will allow us to accept anything that can be turned "into" a <code>String</code>.
