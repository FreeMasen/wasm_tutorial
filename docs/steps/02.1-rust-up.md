The following command will install 3 new applications onto your system
- <code>rustup</code>: A tool for managing your rust installation
- <code>cargo</code>: A tool for managing your rust project
- <code>rustc</code>: The actual rust compiler
</div>

```bash
$ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

<div class="explain">

This will probably take a little while, once it is done you can now confirm evenything is working
by running the following
```bash
$ rustup -V
rustup 1.11.0 (e751ff9f8 2018-02-13)
$ cargo -V
cargo 0.26.0 (41480f5cc 2018-02-26)
$ rustc -V
rustc 1.25.0 (84203cac6 2018-03-25)
```
A new `rustc` is published every 6 weeks and this tool makes it super easy to keep everything in sync.
