<div class="describe">
<p>Two months ago, the back end developer started learning rust and has turned into quite the fanboy. When he was done building the server he exclaimed,</p>
<h3>"I refuse to work with JSON anymore, I will only send and received <a>Bincode</a> from now on."</h3>

<div class="explain">
<p>Bincode it turns out is the serialization format built around the rust memory model so there isn't any kind of specification about it and for sure no js implementations.</p>
<p>The project manager says we can't spend any more time on back-end development so we need to figure out a way to serialize from Bincode to JSON in the browser</p>
