<div class="explain">
To get started we are going to add the required <code>feature</code>, <code>extern crate</code>, and <code>use</code> statements.
</div>

```rust
#![feature(proc_macro, wasm_custom_section, wasm_import_module)]
extern crate bincode;
extern crate serde;
extern crate serde_json;
extern crate wasm_bindgen;
use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

extern crate wasm_tutorial_shared;

use wasm_tutorial_shared::models::{Message, ToDo};
```
<div class="explain">
Next we want to import the <code>console.log</code> function from the <code>js</code> context. We do that by defining an extern block and annotating that with some <code>wasm_bindgen</code> macros.
</div>

```rust
#[wasm_bindgen]
extern {
    #[wasm_bindgen(js_namespace = console)]
    fn log(s: &str);
}
```
<div class="explain">
<p>Notice that we used <code>(js_namespace = console)</code> when we defined <code>log</code>. That is becuase we need to provide a hint to the compiler that the <code>JS</code> side of things will need the <code>console</code> constant infront of it.</p>
<p>Up next we are going to define our function for converting <code>bincode</code> to a <code>JSON</code> string.</p>
</div>

```rust
#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn bincode_to_json(buffer: Vec<u8>) -> String {
    log("bincode_to_json");
    if let Ok(msg) = Message::from_bytes(buffer.to_vec()) {
        match msg.todos() {
            Ok(todos) => {
                if let Ok(ser) = serde_json::to_string(&todos) {
                    return ser
                }
            },
            Err(e) => {
                log(&format!("Error getting todos from msg {:?}", e));
            }
        }
    }
    "[]".into()
}
```
<div class="explain">
<p>Since <code>bincode</code> is just a list of raw 8 bit unsigned integers, we are going to expect that is what comes from the <code>JS</code> context. Once we have that, we can try and convert it from raw bytes into a <code>Message</code> which provides a constructor method called <code>from_bytes</code>. This could fail, for example if the <code>buffer</code> is all 0s, because of that it returns a <code>result</code>. If the conversion is successful we end up with <code>Ok(Message)</code>.</p>
<p>If we have successfully created a <code>Message</code> we want to try and get the <code>Vec&lt;ToDo&gt;</code> from it, we can do that by calling the <code>.todos()</code>method. This is also may fail so we want to <code>match</code> against the return value, if it comes through successfully we then want to try and convert it to JSON by using the <code>serde_json::to_string</code> function. If we can successfully get from <code>Vec&lt;ToDo&gt;</code> then we send that back, at any point if we faile we are going to send an empty array string.</p>
<p>That should handle all of the messages we will need to receive from the server, now we need to define the ones that will faciliate sending to the server.</p>
</div>

```rust
#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn get_add_message(action: String) -> Vec<u8> {
    log(&format!("get_add_message {}", action));
    let todo = ToDo { id: -1, complete: false, action: action };
    let msg = Message::add_client(todo);
    log(&format!("sending back message: {:?}", msg));
    msg.to_bytes()
}

#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn get_update_message(id: f64, complete: bool, action: String) -> Vec<u8> {
    let todo = ToDo { id: id as i32, complete, action };
    let msg = Message::update_client(todo);
    msg.to_bytes()
}
#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn get_remove_message(id: f64, complete: bool, action: String) -> Vec<u8> {
    let todo = ToDo { id: id as i32, complete, action };
    let msg = Message::remove_client(todo);
    msg.to_bytes()
}
```
<div class="explain">
These functions are a little more strait forward than the last one, they take in each of the important properties of a <code>ToDo</code> item and constructs them on the <code>WASM</code> side of things. Once that is done we just construct the message and use the <code>to_bytes()</code> function that will return the bincode representation. 
</div>
