Rust strings are handled a little different than other languages. To start rust has two string types.
- `String` - A heap allocated, growable block of unicode text
- `str` - A static string

When you assign a string literal to a variable, you don't get the `str`, instead you get a reference to it or `&str`. Now I could go into a bunch of details about allocation but that seems beyond this explanation. Just know that a reference (like `&str`) has a lifetime and we either need to define that lifetime which we want to avoid so instead we can create a `String` which doesn't require us to do that.

Because of `rust`'s memory management system modifying the contents of a string can get a little cumbersome. To help out, the `rust` standard library includes a few `macros` to help sugar things up. Any time you see a function called with `!`, like `println!` or `format!`, you know it is a macro.

In our example, we are using the `format!()` macro to allow us to insert a value into a template, like `String.format()` or \`${}\`.
