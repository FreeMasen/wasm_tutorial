Rust strings are handled a little different than other languages. To start rust has two string types.
- `String` - A heap allocated, growable block of unicode text
- `str` - A string literal

Since an `str` is stack allocated, the compiler needs to know how long it lives if it were to be returned from a function, when this cannot be inferred you either need to declare it's lifetime or heap allocate it. Declaring lifetimes is beyond this explaination but simply calling `.to_string()` will heap allocate it and make it safe to return.

Because of `rust`'s memory management system modifying the contents of a string can get a little cumbersome. To help out, the `rust` standard libary includes a few `macros` to help sugar things up. Any time you see a function called with `!`, like `println!` or `format!`, you know it is a macro.
