Rust strings are handled a little different than other languages. To start rust has two string types.
- <code>String</code> - A heap allocated, growable block of unicode text
- <code>str</code> - A static string

When you assign a string literal to a variable, you don't get the <code>str</code>, instead you get a reference to it or <code>&str</code>. Now I could go into a bunch of details about allocation but that seems beyond this explanation. Just know that a reference (like <code>&str</code>) has a lifetime and we either need to define that lifetime which we want to avoid so instead we can create a <code>String</code> which doesn't require us to do that.

Because of <code>rust</code>'s memory management system modifying the contents of a string can get a little cumbersome. To help out, the <code>rust</code> standard library includes a few <code>macros</code> to help sugar things up. Any time you see a function called with <code>!</code>, like <code>println!</code> or <code>format!</code>, you know it is a macro.

In our example, we are using the <code>format!()</code> macro to allow us to insert a value into a template, like <code>String.format()</code> or <code>`${}`</code>.
