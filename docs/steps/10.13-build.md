<div class="explain">
<p>If we look back at our webpack configuration, we are going to be serving all of our files from the <code>dist</code> directory, so first we need to move our <code>.wasm</code> file over to that folder.</p>
</div>

```bash
$ cp ./bincode_parser_bg.wasm ./dist/
```
<div class="explain">

</div>

```bash
$ ./node_modules/.bin/webpack
```
<div class="explain">
