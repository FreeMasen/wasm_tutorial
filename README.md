# wasm_tutorial

This project is used as a contrived example of how to use Web Assembly in the browser today.

[follow the tutorial](https://freemasen.github.io/wasm_tutorial)

If you are ready to see it in action you can execute the following commands

```
git clone https://github.com/freemasen/wasm_tutorial
cd wasm_tutorial
./build_wasm.sh
cargo run
```

The above commands require that you have both the `stable` and `nightly` versions of the rust compiler, the cargo tool `wasm-bindgen-cli`, and `yarn` installed.
